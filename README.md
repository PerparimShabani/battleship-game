# Battleship Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Battleship game using Python. The game is played on a 5x5 grid where the player tries to guess the location of a hidden ship within 10 turns.

## Features

- 5x5 game board
- Random ship placement
- 10 turns to find the ship
- Input validation and error handling

## How to Play

1. Run the `battleship.py` file using Python.
2. The game will display an empty 5x5 grid.
3. Enter row and column numbers (0-4) to guess the ship's location.
4. The game will inform you if you've hit or missed the ship.
5. Try to sink the ship within 10 turns!

## Development Process

This game was developed using Python and follows object-oriented programming principles. The main components include:

- A `Battleship` class that handles the game logic
- A `play_game` function that manages the game flow
- Input validation to handle incorrect user inputs
- Clear user feedback for each action in the game

Version control was managed using Git, with regular commits to track the development process.

## Future Improvements

- Implement multiple ships
- Allow for a larger grid size
- Add a graphical user interface
