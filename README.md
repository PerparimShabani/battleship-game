## Features 

- Random ship placement
- 5 turns to find the ship
- Input validation 
- Simple command-line interface

## Development Process

This project was developed using Visual Studio Code on a Windows computer. The development process included:

1. Setting up the development environment
2. Creating the main game logic
3. Implementing input validation and error handling
4. Adding comments and improving code readability
5. Creating documentation (README.md)
6. Using Git for version control

## Future Improvements

- Add multiple ships
- Implement a larger grid
- Create a graphical user interface
